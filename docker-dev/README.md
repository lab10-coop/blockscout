# Development container for Blockscout

The intention of this container is to deliver a isolated sandbox for development,
without requiring the developer to install Elixier or Postgress for the development cycle,
but still maintaining development speed by not requiring to build a whole docker container,
like it is the case for the /docker/Makefile container
